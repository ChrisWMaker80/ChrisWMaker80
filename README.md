<h3> Background </h3>

I am a dedicated professional with over a decade of hands-on experience in networking and cybersecurity.  

I went to college and took a sample of pre-engineering courses but ultimately decided to go into the direction of technical writing.  Upon graduating, I entered the workforce via entry level tech-support roles where I began to gain exposure to IT infrastructure support. 

After a few years, I moved into network engineering roles that involved implementing modern SD-WAN and wireless systems into enterprise networks. 

I gained an interest in cyber-security and obtained another degree in that domain and continued to study cyber-security as I navigated my career. I continued working in the networking and cyber-security industry until recently touching base with interest in technical communication. 

This GitHub will serve as a simple repository for written and visual projects for display.
